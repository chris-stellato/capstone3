#### Original Project Proposal: Predicting river flows using historical flow and snowpack data

The goal of this project is be to make predictions about future river flows and water levels using historical river flow data and snowpack data and upcoming weather forecasts. The area of flow prediction already has many experts dedicated to this field of study, but predictions are done in a more manual way using historical knowledge and reading upstream gauges to predict timing. These predictions could not only be useful for outdoor recreationalists and water managers, but could also be applied to save property and lives in flood-prone areas. The goal is to be able to predict at least 7 days in advance with reasonable accuracy. 

#### Techniques could include: 
* Machine Learning to predict upcoming river flows (including a time-series component) 
* Image analysis to read in snowpack coverage from satelite imagery
* AWS setup to host and run model
* Flask app to provide interactivity, maybe something where a user could upload data from their own local river if the model is not already trained on that region? 

#### Dataset
Combining USGS river historical river flow data in CFS and SNOTEL site data that contains historical temperature, snowpack, precipitation, and soil saturation data.
